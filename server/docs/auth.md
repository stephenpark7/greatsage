# Step 1: User Authentication

## User Login
When a user logs in to the system with their credentials, the server verifies the credentials and generates a pair of tokens: an **access token** and a **refresh token**.

## Access Token
The access token is a short-lived JWT containing user identification and authorization claims. It's used to access protected resources on the server. This token typically has a short expiration time (e.g., 15 minutes).

## Refresh Token
The refresh token is a long-lived JWT that is used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to log in again. This token has a longer expiration time (e.g., several days or weeks).

# Step 2: Accessing Protected Resources

## Token-Based Authorization
When the user accesses a protected resource on the server, they include the access token in the request, typically in the Authorization header as a Bearer token.

## Token Validation
The server verifies the access token's token, expiration, and any additional claims to ensure its validity. If the token is valid and the user is authorized to access the resource, the request is processed.

# Step 3: Token Expiration and Renewal

## Access Token Expiration
As access tokens have a short expiration time, they eventually expire. When this happens, the user needs to obtain a new access token to continue accessing protected resources.

## Refresh Token Usage
If the access token expires, the client sends the refresh token to the server to obtain a new access token. The refresh token is sent in a secure manner, typically in the request body or in an HTTP-only cookie.

## Token Renewal
The server verifies the refresh token's validity and generates a new access token if the refresh token is valid and has not been revoked. The new access token is returned to the client.

# Step 4: Revoking Tokens with JWT ID (JTI)

## Token Blacklisting
To prevent unauthorized access and token misuse, the server maintains a blacklist of revoked tokens using JWT ID (JTI).

## Blacklisting Process
When a token needs to be revoked (e.g., user logout, token compromise), the server adds the token's JTI to the blacklist.

## Token Validation with JTI
When validating tokens (both access and refresh tokens), the server checks if the token's JTI is present in the blacklist. If the JTI is found, the token is considered revoked, and access is denied.

# Summary
JWT authentication with refresh tokens and JWT ID (JTI) for blacklisting provides a secure and efficient way to authenticate users and manage access to protected resources. By combining short-lived access tokens for authorization, long-lived refresh tokens for token renewal, and JTI-based blacklisting for token revocation, this approach ensures robust security and user authentication in web applications.
